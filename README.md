# Teralib

Teralib, a simple yet fast Java game-framework that does all the nitty-gritty/annoying stuff for you.

# WARNING!
When you first run a Teralib application, there WILL BE bright and flashing colours, it's just how Java lets you know that the
draw buffer is ready to be drawn to, and in the code you can see I allow the buffer to be shown, which is needed. If you have any form of 
mental illness/epilepsy, then put this into `draw(Graphics g)` in your program: `g.setColor(Color.blue); g.fillRect(0, 0, WIDTH, HEIGHT);`
