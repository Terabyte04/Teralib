# Updates to this framework

Hello everyone! I have just begun working on this framework as of 20 Sept, 2018. I want to continue adding updates until I feel everything
is fine and balanced out.

NOTE: This list is not necessarily in order.

NOTE: When something has `[x]` next to it, it means that it's been done. E.G. I've made rendering stuff to the screen a lot easier and more user friendly. So it has a `[x]` next to it to indicate that it's been completed.

# The Next Updates:
    - I plan to add a built-in game-state system
    - I plan to add some abstract class that all of your game-objects should inherit from
    - I plan to add a handler to handle those objects (update, render, input, ...)
    - I plan to add a less verbose `render()` function, so starting out is easier [x]
    - I plan to add a built in maths library (for vectors, points, 3D vectors, etc.)
    - I plan to add JoyStick input, somehow
    - I plan to change "MainLauncher" to something better, as "MainLauncher" isn't a very good name for what it's used for [x]
    - I plan to add easy image loading
    - I plan to add a very easy way to create sprites
    - I plan to add all of the keys on the keyboard [x]
    
Those are all updates I feel are necessary, apart from removing bugs, etc.
