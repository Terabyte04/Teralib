# Updates to this framework

Hello everyone! I have just begun working on this framework as of 20 Sept, 2018. I want to continue adding updates until I feel everything
is fine and balanced out.

# The Next Updates:
    - I plan to add a built-in game-state system
    - I plan to add some abstract class that all of your game-objects should inherit from
    - I plan to add a handler to handle those objects (update, render, input, ...)
    - I plan to add a less verbose `render()` function, so starting out is easier
    - I plan to add a built in maths library (for vectors, points, 3D vectors, etc.)
    - I plan to add JoyStick input, somehow
    - I plan to change "MainLauncher" to something better, as "MainLauncher" isn't a very good name for what it's used for
    
Those are all updates I feel are necesarry, apart from removing bugs, etc.
